<br />
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
This is a short questionnaire to test your fundamental Javascript knowledge!
<br />
The questions are the first 10 questions from the w3school JS quiz at https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_quiz.asp
<br />
The quiz was created for the Monash fullstack bootcamps week 4 assignment challenge and we were certainly thrown in the deep end with this one!
<br />
The application is mobile responsive, it displays well across many mobile and tablet resolutions in landscape and portrat mode. The start button was originally placed on the top left, but moved for aesthetic purposes. This was a trade off as the button placement wont' be perfect on a very small quantity of mobile screen resolutions, though on 95% of devices - it's a large aesthetic imporovement and it doesn't impede functionality on the devices where the button placement isn't quite right.

## Features
<br />
Though it wasn't necessarily a grading requirement, I've implemented scatter functionality to the generated answers. They will be in a random order on each playthrough/ load. The quiz also allows you to save up to 5 high scores. The high scores differs a little from the mock up gif in that it also records the time left, along with the quantity of answers that were answered correctly. I've also changed the high score section to display questions as a fraction. The entry box is capped at 3 characters for initial entry. After inputting your initials, you have an infinite amount of chances to change them should you make a mistake - this will save locally once you play again.
<br />
After 5+ play throughs, you will start over writing the high scores section from score 1 through to score 5 again.
